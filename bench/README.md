# TUI benchmark suite — Ink (`ui-tui`) vs OpenTUI (`ui-opentui`)

Methodology (settled, binding): `docs/plans/opentui-bench-suite.md`. This
directory is the implementation: real binaries over a real node-pty PTY
(120×40, xterm-256color), a fake gateway substituted via `HERMES_PYTHON`
(ZERO changes to either UI), external `/proc` sampling, cgroup-v2 memory caps.
No tmux anywhere in measurement.

## Pieces

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `fake-gateway.mjs` | NDJSON JSON-RPC gateway stand-in. Both UIs spawn it as `$HERMES_PYTHON -m tui_gateway.entry`. Answers every startup RPC with canned results, then streams the fixture (burst / paced / load-then-idle). Never writes stderr (the UIs render gateway stderr). |
| `fixture-stream.mjs` | Serializes the deterministic lumpy-turn fixture (`ui-opentui/scripts/fixture.ts`, imported directly via Node ≥26 type stripping — no port) to NDJSON. Cached under `.cache/`, sha256-stamped. |
| `harness.mjs` | One scenario = one UI boot: node-pty PTY, tight drain loop (event-loop starvation probe, 10ms budget asserted), `/proc/PID/{smaps_rollup,status,stat}` samples on 100-msg boundaries (UI PID only), `systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=… -p MemorySwapMax=0` caps, SGR wheel injection, resize-jiggle digest capture. |
| `run.mjs` | The matrix runner (protocol: determinism gate first, sequential SUTs, randomized per-rep config order, 10s cooldowns, load gate). |
| `render.mjs` | `results/*.json` → self-contained `report.html` (inline SVG, no CDN) + PNGs in `report-assets/`. |

## Running cells

Node 26 is required (`BENCH_NODE_BIN` overrides the default fnm path). Build
both UIs first; results land in `results/<utc>-<sha7>-<cell>-<ui>-<config>-r<rep>.json`.

```sh
cd ui-opentui && node scripts/build.mjs && cd ../ui-tui && node scripts/build.mjs && cd ../bench
npm install                       # node-pty (bench-local devDep)

node run.mjs --cell gate          # determinism gate (digest replay ×2 per UI) — run FIRST
node run.mjs --cell mem3000       # clean memory runs, 3 reps × 3 configs, 2GB cap
node run.mjs --cell slope10k      # one 10k-msg slope run: ink + otui-uncapped (cap-hit IS a datapoint)
node run.mjs --cell nodes         # instrumented node counts (ink fd-3 sampler; opentui headless walk)
node run.mjs --cell cpu           # paced 30 ev/s streaming ×3
node run.mjs --cell scroll        # SGR wheel 30Hz×15s on a 3000-msg transcript ×3
node run.mjs --cell startup       # ×10, fake gateway
node run.mjs --cell chaos         # stability: gw SIGKILL mid-stream/mid-tool, SIGSTOP 30s, resize storm, PTY EOF — 5 scenarios × {ink, otui-capped}
node render.mjs                   # report.html + report-assets/*.png
```

### Chaos cell notes

- **chaos** (5 scenarios × ink/otui-capped, one JSON each, `summary.chaos`):
  gateway death is SELF-inflicted (`HERMES_FAKE_DIE_AT=<msg>:<kill|tool-kill>`
  → SIGKILL at fixture msg N, or at the first `tool.*` event after N) because
  self-termination is deterministic vs racy external timing; a die-once flag
  file keeps the auto-heal respawn from dying again. SIGSTOP (gw-stop) is
  external via `HERMES_FAKE_PIDFILE`. Respawn detection = the respawned
  gateway REWRITING that pidfile. Both UIs auto-heal (budget 3 respawns/60s):
  OpenTUI with exponential backoff (`ui-opentui/src/boundary/gateway/liveGateway.ts`
  `onExit`), Ink immediately (`ui-tui/src/app/useMainApp.ts` `exitHandler`).
  `transcript_preserved` = after a forced full repaint (resize jiggle), the
  screen still shows a recent pre-kill turn (`const xN` fixture markers).
  `summary.result` keeps its usual semantics — for pty-eof the UI *should*
  die, so read `summary.chaos`, not `summary.result`, for the verdicts.

Configs: `ink` · `otui-capped` (`HERMES_TUI_MAX_MESSAGES=3000`, the default) ·
`otui-uncapped` (`=100000`). Launch parity with `hermes_cli/main.py`:
Ink = `node --expose-gc ui-tui/dist/entry.js`, OpenTUI =
`node --experimental-ffi --no-warnings ui-opentui/dist/main.js`, both with
`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=<heap>` (8192 on the unconstrained host —
what the launcher picks outside a container).

## E3 (constrained Docker survival)

`E3-lite` runs the same harness inside a generic `node:26` container (NOT the
shipped image) with the worktree bind-mounted read-only and `--memory=1g
--memory-swap=1g`; the whole container (UI + fake gateway + harness) shares the
limit. See `run-e3.sh` if present, or the report's survival table for the exact
invocation used.

## What actually ran on 2026-06-11 (E1 host + E3-lite) — deviations from the plan

- **3 reps** for mem3000 (not 5) and **scroll at 2000 msgs** (not 3000): the
  OpenTUI engine on this tree (sha 197d499, dist built from 50e3471 tree state)
  **crashes at ≈3000 fixture msgs** — an uncaught `Error: Failed to create
  SyntaxStyle` (native handle allocation fails; every `TextBufferRenderable`
  creates one in @opentui/core 0.4.0), masked by a second
  `Failed to create optimized buffer` crash inside the renderer's
  uncaughtException handler. Postmortems are in each result's `pty_tail`;
  RSS at crash ≈880MB — far below the 2GB cap, so it is a handle/pool limit,
  not memory. This dominates every OpenTUI cell past ~3000 msgs.
- **OpenTUI headless node-count: not run.** `scripts/mem-bench.tsx` under Node
  FFI dies on the first fixture turn with `ERR_INVALID_ARG_VALUE … 
  textBufferViewSetViewport` (the known Bun→Node u32-coordinate class; the
  production binary carries the ffiSafe clamp, the headless test renderer path
  does not) and then hangs. The Ink fd-3 sampler ran fine.
- **Startup real-gateway variant: probed, not run as a cell.** A full run would
  forge real sessions in the user's `~/.hermes` store. Measured standalone:
  the real `tui_gateway` (venv python) emits `gateway.ready` in **131ms median**
  (×10, range 130–138ms) — add that to the fake-gateway startup numbers.
- **No cgroup OOM kills observed** anywhere (Ink at 10k msgs peaks ~321MB;
  OpenTUI crashes before reaching the cap), so the cap-hit machinery
  (memory.events / journal fallback) never fired in anger; E3-lite classified
  the OpenTUI death correctly as a crash (`oom_kill=0`, exit 7).
- E2 (shipped Docker image): not run — image build time prohibitive in this
  session; E3-lite (generic node:26) covers the constrained-memory question.
- Drain-loop starvation: a handful of OpenTUI burst runs recorded 11–18ms max
  event-loop lag in the harness (>10ms budget, flagged `drain_ok:false` in
  those results); all paced/scroll/startup runs stayed under 10ms.

## Accounting + known deviations (by design)

- **"messages" = fixture rows** (`rowsPerTurn` accounting, identical to
  `ui-opentui/scripts/mem-bench.tsx`), so numbers are comparable with the
  pre-registered expectations. ~46% of fixture rows are user/system rows.
- **User/system rows are not streamed**: they are composer-local in both UIs
  (no wire event exists), so PTY runs mount only the assistant/tool rows —
  the renderable-heavy part that carries the memory claim. Consequence: the
  OpenTUI store cap (3000 rows) binds at ≈6.6k fixture-msgs in PTY runs.
- **Digest gate**: final-screen digest after a resize-forced repaint, ANSI
  stripped, cut at the composer hint, `up: Ns` normalized (the OpenTUI status
  bar has a 1Hz uptime clock; the transcript region itself is deterministic).
- The headless `scripts/mem-bench.tsx` numbers are diagnostic-only and flagged
  `instrumented`/`diagnostic_only` — never headlined.

## Build/run parity vs an installed hermes (audit, 2026-06-11)
- Both UIs are built by their own repo build scripts (same artifacts an install produces) and
  spawned at their real entries: otui `node --experimental-ffi --no-warnings dist/main.js`
  (identical to production); ink `dist/entry.js` with env mirroring `_launch_tui`
  (NODE_ENV=production).
- Two deviations: (1) ink's spawn adds `--expose-gc` — audited: nothing ever calls gc(), the
  flag is inert; kept for the instrumented sampler runs, harmless in clean runs. (2) both UIs
  run on the pinned Node 26.3 per protocol ("never compare across Node majors") — installed ink
  commonly runs Node 20/22, so ink's ABSOLUTE numbers are "ink on Node 26"; the relative
  comparison is unaffected. An as-installed-Node ink re-run is a worthwhile extra cell.
